*The model is extremely demanding on hardware.*

Even on 24 Gigabytes, the speed of the model in the full version leaves much to be desired, since this basic flow does not fit completely into the video card cache.

Lightning versions are quite good and generate quite good pictures in 4 steps.

Totally with these models there are 4 different flows:

* Flux
* Flux (Small)
* Flux Lighting
* Flux Lighting (Small)

**Supports various aspect ratios.**

**Supports different number of steps for non-Lighting versions.**

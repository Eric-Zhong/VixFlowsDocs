Inpaint
=======

.. warning::
    Inpaint flows are currently in beta, expect many changes in UI regarding this.

Currently only a few inpaint flows are available: Flux Redraw, Flux Redraw (Small), Flux Redraw Lighting (Small) and ColorfulXL.

Inpainting is hard, you always need to try to select the correct **Replacing factor** parameter, and it strongly depends on the image and the flow.

As examples, we will use real photos, it is harder to inpaint them, since they have a high resolution, and current models draw in 1024x1024 resolution.

It is easier to "repaint" photos generated with AI, as they have usually low resolutions.

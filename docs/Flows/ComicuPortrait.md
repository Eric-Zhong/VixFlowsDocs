# ComicU Anime Portrait

Create an anime(sketch by default) image from a photo of a person.

**Prompt** is optional, something like emotions can be used there: *smile, sad, serious, etc*.

> *If you ticked the "Disable Simple style" you can try to add something like* **line-sketch** *to the prompt.*

Part of the flow runs on the CPU, part on the GPU, the flow is quite fast and convenient for everyday use.

## Examples

> As input files, the photos of `Bruce Lee` and `Shakira` were taken from the Internet and used.

# Aesthetic images (Playground 2.5)

The flow focuses on three key improvements: enhancing color and contrast, generating images across multiple aspect ratios, and aligning outputs with human aesthetic preferences.


It demonstrates superior performance over previous models and commercial systems in terms of aesthetic quality, especially in generating vibrant colors, accommodating different aspect ratios, and capturing fine details in human-centric images.


Playground v2.5 outperforms widely-used models and even some closed-source systems in user studies focusing on aesthetic preferences.

**Supports various aspect ratios.**

**Supports fast generation using the Align Steps technique**

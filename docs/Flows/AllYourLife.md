# All Your Life

[Original Workflow](https://openart.ai/workflows/datou/all-your-life-ver-12/KdNc8OnmzTieGRBkGHks) by Datou.

Workflow is quite demanding, 8 images in a batch generates throw 2 nodes using 8 steps in each(128 steps total) - so it if not blazing fast.

Photos are best given when person are relatively young or middle-aged.

Don't even try to give photos of an old person unless you want to get a video from a horror movie.

# StableDiffusion3-Medium

Flow using the gated model, requires a HuggingFace token to setup.

*This flow is made more for development and verification that we have successfully added the ability to use gated/closed models.*

> In the future this Flow will either be modernized or removed when something better appears to replace it based on the feature-tuned SD3, if there are any.

**Supports various aspect ratios.**

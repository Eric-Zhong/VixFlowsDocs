# Memoji Portrait

Create cute Memoji from a photo of a person.

**Prompt** is required, simplest examples is: `girl, portrait, close up`

    To make it look more like Memoji you can add **sico style** words:
    `**sico style**, girl, portrait, close up`

**Person's face pose** is optional.

Part of the flow runs on the CPU, part on the GPU, the flow is quite fast and convenient for everyday use.

## Examples

> As input files, the photos of `Bruce Lee` and `Einstein` were taken from the Internet and used.

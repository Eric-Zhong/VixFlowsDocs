# Inpaint

Currently only a few inpaint flows are available:

* Flux Redraw
* Flux Redraw (Small)
* Flux Redraw Lighting (Small)
* ColorfulXL

Inpainting is hard, you always need to try to select the correct **Replacing factor** parameter, and it strongly depends on the image and the flow.

As examples, we will use real photos, it is harder to inpaint them, since they have a high resolution, and current models draw in 1024x1024 resolution.

It is easier to "repaint" photos generated with AI, as they have usually low resolutions.

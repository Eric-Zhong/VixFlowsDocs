.. _HumanFaceDetailer:

Human Face Detailer
===================

Initially this was part of Playground 2.5 Aesthetics Flow **until Visionatrix 1.0** version.

It was decided to move it to a separate flow, so that it would be convenient to send the result of any flow here.

This flow works by default at the moment on the CPU.

The maximum number of faces for redrawing on a portrait is limited to **3**.

If no faces are found in the input image, nothing will be redrawn.
